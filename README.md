Image Responsiveness Optimization by Ratio (iror)

This is a jQuery plugin to enhance the responsiveness of background images, stretching and moving them around, while also respecting it's ratio.

You can choose between 2 behaviors for your background:
- match the browser's window size (default)
- match an element's contents' size (a div for example)

Additionally, iror allows you to set the following for each background image:
- focal point
- callback on bg image load

				});`
